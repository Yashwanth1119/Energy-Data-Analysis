# **Energy Data Analysis**

A simple python implementation with EDA

### **Problem Statement**

Today, as countries try to diversify their energy portfolios and effect a greater reliance on
cleaner power, they are left with one major problem. The two main sources of renewable
energy- solar and wind- are, in their very nature, variable. The power generated by a solar
panel or a wind turbine is never uniform and depends on a range of external factors â€”
intensity of solar radiation, cloud cover, wind speed â€” that canâ€™t be controlled.
1. The folder raw.zip has raw files which were measured in a station. As the name
indicates, there are 2 inverters, 1 energy meter (named MFM) and 1 meteorological
substation (named WMS)
2. The raw data is a stream of data which gets recorded by the sensors on the field and
is
sent over the cloud.
3. The raw data is cleansed into a Gen-1 data format, here the following operations are
performed:
a. For Inverters
i. For inverters, column i32 indicates the timestamp of the row. Make this as the first
column in
the Gen1 file and rename the column header to â€˜Timestampâ€™).
b. For Energy meters (MFM)
i. Same rules as above, only difference is timestamp column is m63
c. For Energy meters (MFM)
i. Same rules as above, only difference is timestamp column is w23
